## How this works

At the moment we are busy externalising all of our strings, so the only two areas that currently work are:
 1. Timestamps in chat
 2. Homepage

## Homepage instructions

We manually exported the HTML from our build system. Some aspects of the page won't work if you run it locally, but it's easily possible just to edit the content and send us back a pull request.

See the homepage directory in this repo for languages we have translated before. Feel free to submit an entirely new file for your language.

## Additional areas of the application

We will continue to expand on the entire application over time. Please watch this repository for updates
