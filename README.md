## How this works

At the moment we are busy externalising all of our strings, so the only two areas that currently work are:
 1. Timestamps in chat
 2. Homepage

## Homepage instructions

The homepage strings are kept in the homepage directory

## Additional areas of the application

We will continue to expand on the entire application over time. Please watch this repository for updates
